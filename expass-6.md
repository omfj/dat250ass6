# DAT250 Assignment 6

## Technical issues

Not an issue per se, but I did not use the callback method for the experiments, but `await` instead. I found it easier to read and use.

## Link to the code

You can read the README.md on how to run each experiment.

The code for "Hello World" can be found in the `hello-world` folder.

The code for "Work Queues" can be found in the `work-queues` folder.

The code for "Topics" can be found in the `topics` folder.

## Pending issues

No pending issues.
